# Veltroa-Forge
Veltroa Forge is the lead project of the Veltroa stack, a fresh approach to fullstack development. Built with React, Next.js, and Node.js in one file, it's designed to explore powerful ideas in a simple, readable way. This project is a starting point for bold builds, creative prototypes, and modern web apps, all forged in one place.
